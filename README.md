# Global-Powerplants-Database-WRI-
This project is a visual representation of the Global Powerplants Database (WRI) aimed at providing an interactive and intuitive way to explore the data and better understand the energy landscape of countries and regions around the world.
This project leverages open data sources and cutting-edge data visualization techniques to create a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily filter, compare and analyze data across a range of criteria. Whether you're looking to explore the distribution of power generation by fuel type, the growth of renewable energy, or the carbon footprint of different countries, this project provides a wealth of information and insights at your fingertips.
The Global Powerplants Database (WRI) is a comprehensive and up-to-date database of power generation facilities around the world, covering over 240 countries and territories. It provides a wealth of data on energy generation capacity, fuel types, plant ownership, and much more. By visualizing this data in an interactive and accessible way, we hope to help people better understand the current state of the energy landscape, and to support informed decision making in the energy sector.
This project is open source and contributions from the community are welcome. If you are interested in contributing or have any questions about the data or the visualization, please feel free to reach out.
